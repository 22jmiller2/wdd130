    <h1>Favorite City</h1>
    <p>West Bountiful City is my favorite city. It not only has a good history, but it has a great
        community! The population of West Bountiful has more than doubled in the past 21 years. Even
        with all of this new development, you can still see its roots as a farming community. </p>
